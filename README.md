GlamApply is a Dalamud plugin that lets you apply glamour plates with a chat command.

Examples: 
Typing `/gp 11` applies glamour plate 11 to your current equipped gear. 
Typing `/gp` with no plate number will reset your glamour to the glamour plate linked to the current gearset.

## How to Install

GlamApply is not available in the standard Dalamud plugin repository and must be installed from my third party repository.
